# Refactor Tasks — Type-Driven HAL

**Branch:** `refactor/type-driven-hal`
**Source-of-truth:** `docs/REFACTOR_BRIEF.md`
**Status legend:** ✅ done · 🟡 in progress · ⬜ pending

Order is binding. Each task is atomic; build + tests must be green at
the end of each task before the next begins.

## P1 — V2 providers, codegen, conformance (long-running)

Each P1 task ends in its own commit. Foundation must remain stable —
P0 headers must not be edited during P1.

| ID    | Task                                                                       | Depends on | Status |

## STOP conditions

The agent (human or AI) MUST halt and ask before continuing if any of
these become true:

1. A test that was green at the start of the task fails for an
   unrelated reason.
2. A C-API symbol referenced in the brief or a header does not exist
   in the implementation source (or vice versa).
3. A mock backend produces data inconsistent with the protocol spec.
4. More than 3 build attempts on a single task fail — the architectural
   assumption was wrong; do not paper over.
5. The task would touch a file the brief lists as protected
   (`uft_gw_*` signatures, `tests/golden/`, `docs/DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md`).
6. A single commit would touch more than 50 files.

In any of these cases:
- commit current state with `WIP:` prefix and a one-line marker
  describing the stop reason,
- record details in `docs/REFACTOR_NOTES.md`,
- wait for human input.

## Per-task contract

Every task ends with all of the following true:

- [ ] `cmake --build build` (or `qmake && mingw32-make`) green
- [ ] `ctest --output-on-failure` green; conformance test count ≥ baseline
- [ ] `python scripts/check_consistency.py` 0/0/0/0
- [ ] `python scripts/verify_build_sources.py` no new regressions
- [ ] commit message follows Conventional Commits + carries an MF-NNN
- [ ] this task's row in this table flipped to ✅

If any of those is not satisfied, the task is **not done**, regardless
of how complete the code looks.
