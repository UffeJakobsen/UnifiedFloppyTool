/**
 * @file fluxwritejob.h
 * @brief Worker thread that writes an SCP flux image to a real disk via
 *        the Greaseweazle HAL. Symmetric counterpart to FluxCaptureJob.
 *
 * Closes MF-114 (the destination half of MF-110): the WorkflowTab combo
 * "Source = Image File, Destination = Flux Device" used to fall through
 * the legacy DecodeJob path which has no idea how to talk to hardware,
 * so the operation either silently did nothing or aborted with a
 * misleading file-related error.
 *
 * Forensic-integrity rules: this job does NOT decode the SCP, does NOT
 * remap tracks, and does NOT re-time anything. It writes flux intervals
 * exactly as they came out of the SCP file, with the only conversion
 * being ns → device ticks against the live sample_freq. A short write,
 * a track read failure, or a HAL error stops the run; we never silently
 * skip to the next track and pretend the disk was written.
