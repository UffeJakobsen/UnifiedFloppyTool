/**
 * @file fluxengine_provider_v2.h
 * @brief FluxEngineProviderV2 — mixin-composed V2 HAL provider (MF-163 / P1.10).
 *
 * Refactor branch: refactor/type-driven-hal
 *
 * Capabilities (backed by fluxengine-CLI subprocess invocations):
 *   ReadsRawFlux   v  do_read_raw_flux()   -> FluxOutcome
 *   WritesRawFlux  v  do_write_raw_flux()  -> WriteOutcome
 *   DetectsDrive   v  do_detect_drive()    -> DetectOutcome
 *   MeasuresRPM    v  do_measure_rpm()     -> RpmOutcome
 *
 * V1 audit findings — real vs. silent stubs:
 *   readRawFlux()   REAL  — runs `fluxengine read ibm -s drive:0 -c N -h N
 *                           --revs=N -o tempfile`; reads temp file for raw bytes.
 *   writeRawFlux()  REAL  — runs `fluxengine write ibm -d drive:0 -c N -h N
 *                           -i tempfile`; optional verify by re-reading.
 *   detectDrive()   REAL  — runs `fluxengine rpm`; parses stdout for RPM and
 *                           emits a DriveDetected record.
 *   measureRPM()    REAL  — runs `fluxengine rpm`; parses RPM from stdout.
 *   setMotor()      STUB  — sets m_motorOn flag only; no CLI invocation.
 *   seekCylinder()  STUB  — sets m_currentCylinder flag only; no CLI invocation.
 *   recalibrate()   STUB  — delegates to seekCylinder(0) which is itself a stub.
 *
 * Intentionally omitted mixins (and why):
 *   ReadsSectors    x  FluxEngine is a flux device. Sector decoding happens
 *                      in the upstream analysis pipeline, not the HAL layer.
 *   WritesSectors   x  Same rationale as ReadsSectors.
 *   ControlsMotor   x  The V1 setMotor() is a silent stub — only records
 *                      state locally. FluxEngine CLI abstracts motor control
 *                      implicitly within each read/write invocation; there is
 *                      no standalone `fluxengine motor` command. Omitting this
 *                      mixin is the structurally honest choice (anti-pragmatism
 *                      rule: "no WIP capability").
 *   SeeksHead       x  The V1 seekCylinder() is a silent stub — FluxEngine
 *                      CLI handles seeking implicitly via -c flag. No
 *                      standalone `fluxengine seek` command exists.
 *   Recalibrates    x  The V1 recalibrate() delegates to seekCylinder(0)
 *                      which is itself a silent stub. No fluxengine recalibrate
 *                      primitive exists.
 *
 * SpecStatus: CommunityConsensus — FluxEngine is an open-source project
 *   (David Given's tool, https://github.com/davidgiven/fluxengine) with a
 *   public GitHub README that serves as the authoritative CLI reference.
 *   The tool is not accompanied by a formal vendor SDK or published standard,
 *   but the CLI interface and flux file format are documented through the
 *   project's README, wiki, and source code, which represents community
 *   consensus documentation. CommunityConsensus is more accurate than
 *   VendorDocumented (no formal SDK) or ReverseEngineered (source is public).
 *
 * Backend: fluxengine CLI subprocess.
 *   FluxEngine has no C-HAL backbone in this codebase. The V1 provider
 *   calls fluxengine via QProcess. The V2 makes the subprocess runner
 *   injectable, decoupling the type from Qt.
 *
 * FluxEngine runner design — Option (A): std::function injection.
 *   Mirrors KryoFluxProviderV2's DtcRunner pattern exactly. The V2
 *   constructor takes a `FluxEngineRunner` — a std::function with signature:
 *     FluxEngineRunResult(const std::vector<std::string>& argv,
 *                         const std::string& stdin_data)
 *   FluxEngineRunResult is a plain struct (stdout_text, stderr_text, exit_code)
 *   structurally identical to DtcRunResult. It is defined separately here
 *   to avoid a cross-type dependency between KryoFlux and FluxEngine provider
 *   code. The small structural duplication is acknowledged and accepted:
 *   using a shared `SubprocessRunResult` alias would require a common header
 *   that is itself a cross-cutting change outside this task's scope.
 *
 *   In production, the caller provides a lambda that wraps QProcess::start().
 *   In tests, the caller provides SubprocessMock::run as an adapted lambda.
 *
 * Rule F-3 (multi-revolution preservation):
 *   The V1 readRawFlux() calls readTrack() which invokes fluxengine with
 *   --revs=N and writes the captured flux to a temp file (.flux format).
 *   The raw file bytes are read verbatim. The V2 do_read_raw_flux() preserves
 *   all raw flux bytes exactly as returned by the runner (via stdout_text in
 *   mock/test mode, or via a file-read wrapper in production). No resampling,
 *   no averaging, no collapsing. The revolutions field is set to the requested
 *   value. FluxEngine's .flux format uses 8 MHz sampling (125 ns per tick).
 *
 * Rule F-4: every ProviderError carries non-empty what/why/fix strings.
 *   The ProviderError constructor throws std::logic_error on empty strings.
 *
 * Write + verify semantics (carried from V1):
 *   The V1 writeTrack() optionally re-reads the track after writing to verify.
 *   WriteFluxParams::verify controls this. If verify is requested and the
 *   re-read returns empty data, V2 returns WriteVerifyFailed with the intended
 *   stream and an empty readback. This preserves the forensic record of what
 *   was written and what came back.
 *
 * Backend honesty (no-fluxengine path):
 *   If the runner is null or returns exit_code != 0, do_* methods return
 *   ProviderError with a clear what/why/fix. This is the correct behavior
 *   when the fluxengine binary is not installed or the device is not connected.
 *
 * The V1 FluxEngineHardwareProvider is NOT deleted here (task P1.17).
 * This file introduces the V2 type in parallel.
