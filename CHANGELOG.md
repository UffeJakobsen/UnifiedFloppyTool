# Changelog

## [4.1.4-rc1] - 2026-05 (pre-release)

### Internal Refactor — Type-Driven HAL (MF-150 … MF-172)

This release replaces UFT's dual-architecture hardware abstraction
(C HAL fast-path + Qt provider class hierarchy in parallel) with a
single type-driven HAL. The change is mechanical inside the codebase
but invisible to the working Greaseweazle workflow.

**Architecture (additions):**
- Foundation headers `include/uft/hal/{outcomes,concepts,mixins}.h`
  introducing `std::variant` sum-type outcomes (SectorOutcome,
  FluxOutcome, MotorOutcome, …), C++20 capability concepts
  (ReadsRawFlux, ControlsMotor, …), and CRTP mixin templates
  (`ReadsRawFluxVia<Backend>` …) for provider composition (MF-150).
- 10 mixin-composed V2 providers (one per controller + a synthetic
  MockProviderV2): GreaseweazleProviderV2, SCPProviderV2,
  KryoFluxProviderV2, FluxEngineProviderV2, FC5025ProviderV2,
  XUM1541ProviderV2, ApplesauceProviderV2, ADFCopyProviderV2,
  USBFloppyProviderV2 (MF-154, MF-161–MF-168).
- GUI action wiring is now code-generated from
  `forms/tab_hardware.actions.yaml` via `tools/wiring_codegen.py`
  into `generated/tab_hardware_wiring.gen.cpp`. The runtime template
  `wire_action<cap::X>` (in `include/uft/gui/wiring_runtime.h`)
  enables/disables the button based on compile-time capability
  membership and dispatches outcomes through `std::visit` (MF-152,
  MF-155, MF-156, MF-157).
- Conformance test harness `tests/test_hal_conformance.cpp` runs 65
  forensic-invariant sections across all 10 V2 providers — every
  per-variant invariant (rule F-3 divergent-reads preservation, rule
  F-4 3-part-error contract, etc.) is now compile-time-checked +
  runtime-validated (MF-158).
- Three transport mocks in `tests/mock_hardware/` (usb_loopback,
  subprocess, serial) provide deterministic byte-stream fixtures
  for the conformance loop without requiring real hardware (MF-159).

**Removals (V1 hierarchy):**
- The V1 `HardwareProvider` base class, the `HardwareManager`
  dispatcher, and 11 V1 provider classes (`*hardwareprovider.{h,cpp}`)
  are gone — 29 files, ~12 700 LOC deleted (MF-169).
- The `unified_hal_bridge` Qt↔C bridge that converted
  `uft_track_t` to the V1 `TrackData` DTO is gone with the V1
  hierarchy.
- The X1541-family controller-combo entries (XA1541, XAP1541,
  XM1541, XE1541, X1541) and their parallel-port enumeration
  helper are removed — they were phantom-features without a
  matching provider class (MF-170).
- `uft_gw_*` C-API calls are now ONLY in
  `GreaseweazleProviderV2::open()/close()/do_*()`. HardwareTab has
  zero direct `uft_gw_*` references (MF-171).

**User-visible changes:**
- Greaseweazle workflow (read, write, detect, motor, seek, RPM,
  recalibrate): structurally hardened, behavior preserved.
- 8 non-Greaseweazle controllers (SCP, KryoFlux, FluxEngine, FC5025,
  XUM1541, Applesauce, ADFCopy, USBFloppy) now display a clear
  "Controller routing pending" message on Connect instead of
  silently no-op'ing. The V2 wrappers exist and conform; the
  HardwareTab → V2 routing for non-GW is task P1.23 (queued for
  v4.1.5).
- 5 X1541-family combo entries are gone (never had a working
  backend; selected workflows always errored).

**Known-issue resolutions:**
- KNOWN_ISSUES H-1 (GUI freezes during hardware imaging) resolved
  by the V2 worker-thread routing introduced in MF-147.
- KNOWN_ISSUES H-2 (silent stubs in HardwareProvider derivatives)
  resolved structurally — every silent stub became a missing
  mixin, no longer expressible at the type level.
- KNOWN_ISSUES H-9 (deprecated `TrackData::errorMessage` alias)
  resolved by removing the V1 DTOs entirely.

**Quality gates that ship with this RC:**
- 14 test executables green (test_hal_foundation,
  test_hal_conformance, test_greaseweazle_v2, test_scp_provider_v2,
  test_kryoflux_provider_v2, test_fluxengine_provider_v2,
  test_fc5025_provider_v2, test_xum1541_provider_v2,
  test_applesauce_provider_v2, test_adfcopy_provider_v2,
  test_usbfloppy_provider_v2, test_mock_provider_v2,
  test_mock_hardware, test_wiring_runtime).
- 65 conformance sections / 0 failed.
- `scripts/check_consistency.py` 0/0/0/0.
- `scripts/verify_build_sources.py` no new divergence.
- `tools/wiring_codegen_tests/run_tests.py` 6/6 (incl. drift gate
  comparing committed `generated/tab_hardware_wiring.gen.cpp`
  against a fresh regeneration).
- C++20 mandatory (was C++17).

**Carry-overs for v4.1.5+ (documented in REFACTOR_TASKS.md):**
- P1.20 — Migrate FluxCaptureJob to V2 outcome surface.
- P1.21 — Migrate FluxWriteJob to V2 outcome surface.
- P1.22 — Remove the `GreaseweazleProviderV2::raw_handle()` /
  `HardwareTab::gwDevice()` legacy escape hatch.
- P1.23 — Route the 8 non-Greaseweazle controllers through their
  V2 providers (variant-dispatch in HardwareTab).
- P3.1–P3.4 — Tester strategy (differential conformance against
  Greaseweazle v1.23, improvement test suite, HIL infrastructure).

**Forensic-mission status:**
- Rule F-3 (preserve divergent reads, never collapse) — enforced
  at every Sum-Type Marginal/VerifyFailed alternative.
- Rule F-4 (3-part error messages) — type-enforced via
  `ProviderError`'s throwing constructor.
- Rule H-1 (no enabled action without backing capability) —
  structural via codegen's Phase 2 disable path.
- Rule H-3 (action without provider) — structural via codegen
  validation against `KNOWN_CAPABILITIES`.
- Rule D-2 (SpecStatus per provider) — type-mandated.

### Hot-Fixes Included (predate the refactor — MF-129, MF-141, MF-145, MF-146)

These fixes were tracked as the "planned 4.1.4 hot-fix" before the
Type-Driven HAL refactor was decided; they ship in the same RC.

- **Windows COM-port-prefix bug across four QSerialPort-based hardware
  providers** (MF-145 / FB user-report). Greaseweazle, SuperCard Pro,
  Applesauce, and ADF-Copy each pre-applied the Win32 device-namespace
  prefix `\\.\` before calling `QSerialPort::setPortName()`. Qt's
  `QSerialPort` adds that prefix internally; the pre-application caused
  `DeviceNotFoundError` on Qt 6.7+ or silently broken handles on older
  Qt. Symptom matched the user report: "hardware will not access the
  floppy drive" on Windows. The bug never surfaced for Greaseweazle on
  the production code path (UI → C-HAL `uft_gw_open()` uses
  `CreateFileA` directly, where the prefix is correct), but it did
  affect SCP / Applesauce / ADF-Copy which route through the Qt
  provider. The bug-fix code is now inherent in the V2 providers
  introduced by the refactor — the V1 sites that had it were deleted
  along with the V1 hierarchy (MF-169). USB-Floppy provider's
  `\\.\A:` and `\\.\B:` paths are intentionally retained: that
  provider uses `DeviceIoControl` SCSI pass-through where the prefix
  is the correct Win32 convention for direct volume access.
- **Applesauce ↔ ADF-Copy VID/PID disambiguation** (MF-146). Both
  controllers ship with the generic PJRC Teensy USB ID
  (VID `0x16C0` / PID `0x0483`). Previously, both providers' detect
  paths candidate-matched any 0x16C0:0x0483 device, then attempted
  their own protocol handshake — racing for the same port during
  auto-detect. The new ApplesauceProviderV2 + ADFCopyProviderV2
  detect-runners skip ports whose USB manufacturer / description
  string identifies the *other* controller. Eliminates the
  double-claim on systems where only one device is attached.
- **Greaseweazle bootloader-mode detection** (MF-129). `uft_gw_open()`
  refuses bootloader-firmware boards with an actionable error
  (`UFT_GW_ERR_BOOTLOADER`), surfaced via `ProviderError.fix` as
  recovery hints instead of a generic "I/O error".
- **MFM IDAM/DAM standalone sector parser** (MF-141 / AUD-002).
  SCP→ADF/IMG/D64 conversion path decodes sectors via a reusable
  API with explicit CRC validation and CHRN-keyed LBA mapping.
  Previously the inline parser dropped sectors after IDAM, ignored
  CRCs, and placed payloads in scan order instead of by sector ID.

### Build / Tooling

- `uft_version.h` is regenerated from `VERSION.txt` at every qmake
  parse / CMake configure (MF-131). Removes the `DEFINES+=
  UFT_VERSION_STRING=\\\"...\\\"` quoting fragility from
  `release.yml` (MF-145).
- `scripts/check_consistency.py --check version` scans
  `RELEASE_NOTES.md` headline + Doxygen `@version` tags too
  (MF-128). Pre-push gate now blocks 5 distinct version-drift
  classes.
- `tools/wiring_codegen_tests/run_tests.py` is a new CI smoke
  with 6 cases: happy-path / H-3 surface (missing widget) / H-4
  surface (unknown capability) / idempotence / production-YAML
  validation / committed-`.gen.cpp`-is-fresh drift detector.
